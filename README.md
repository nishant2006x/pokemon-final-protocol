## This is my first ever serious project ever created, I made it purely for entertainment and did not take into account code organization or effectiveness at that time; therefore, please expect the project's code to be a bit messy.

## How to Play

- Make sure Python 3 is installed.
- If dependencies are missing, run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Simply run `GameFiles/scripts/main.py` on a valid platform/IDE!
- OR Run on Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell):
  ```bash
  cd GameFiles\scripts
  python main.py
  ```
- OR Run on Mac (Terminal):
  ```bash
  cd GameFiles/scripts
  python3 main.py
  ```
