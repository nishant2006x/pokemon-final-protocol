## This is my first ever serious project ever created, I made it purely for entertainment and did not take into account code organization or effectiveness at that time; therefore, please expect the project's code to be a bit messy.

## How to Play

- Simply run `GameFiles/scripts/main.py` on a valid platform/IDE.
- Make sure Python 3 is installed.
- If dependencies are missing, run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
