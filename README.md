## This is my first ever serious project ever created, I made it purely for entertainment and did not take into account code organization or effectiveness at that time; therefore, please expect the project's code to be a bit messy.

## How to Play (Step-By-Step)

- Step 1: Make sure Python 3 is installed.
- Step 2: If dependencies are missing, run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Step 3: Simply run `GameFiles/scripts/main.py` on a valid platform/IDE! If you do not have a valid platform/IDE:
  
    - Run on Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell):
      ```bash
      cd GameFiles\scripts
      python main.py
      ```
    - OR Run on Mac (Terminal):
      ```bash
      cd GameFiles/scripts
      python3 main.py
      ```
